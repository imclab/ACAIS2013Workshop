After a floor has been added we can add more objects to our world. We will start with agents.

\instruct{Create a new file agents.py}

As we are going to use functions (and classes) of the breve engine, we must import it at the top of our file.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import breve
\end{lstlisting}

\instruct{Add the import statement to the top of our agents file.}

\section{Creating a simple agent}

We will start with a very simple agent which will do nothing but stand still. Every agent must extend the \textit{breve.Mobile} class in order for it to move and interact.

Just as with our controller, we have to add a constructor and an \textit{iterate} function.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class SimpleAgent (breve.Mobile):

	def __init__(self):
		breve.Mobile.__init__(self)

		print "Created agent"

	def iterate(self):
		None
\end{lstlisting}

\instruct{Add the class definition above to the agents file.}

\instruct{Try to run the simulation and see what happens.}

As you can see nothing happened yet. This is because we still have to add our agent to the environment. This is done through the simulation controller.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
self.agent = agents.SimpleAgent()
\end{lstlisting}

\instruct{Add the following snippet to the \textit{\_\_init\_\_} function of the controller, just below the lighting settings.}

We now have a single agent in our environment.
