Every simulation is based around a \textit{Controller} which controls the simulation. To make such a controller we extend the \textit{Breve.Control} class and implement two methods: the constructor and a iterate method.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import breve

class SimulationController ( breve.Control ):

        def __init__( self ):
                breve.Control.__init__(self)

                print "Simulation Started"

        def iterate( self ):

                breve.Control.iterate( self )

# Start the simulation
SimulationController()
\end{lstlisting}



\instruct{Save the code above in a file called SimulationController.py.}

The \textit{\_\_init\_\_} function is called when the simulation starts and can be used to initialise other components (such as agents). 

The \textit{iterate} function is called on every iteration in the simulation. It is important to call the parent iterate method in \textit{Breve.Control}, without this the simulation will not run.

\instruct{Run the simulation to test your controller.}
