The second object we will be adding is food. This gives our agents something that they can interact with.

\instruct{Create a new file food.py}

As we are going to use functions (and classes) of the breve engine, we must import it at the top of our file.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import breve
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Creating the food agent}

Our initial version of the food is very simple, it will simply stay on the field. Every food source must extend the \textit{breve.Mobile} class. Food does not have to move, but we want to be able to interact with it.
