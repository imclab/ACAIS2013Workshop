Now that we have created the basics of our \textit{Artificial Life} simulation, \textit{agents} and \textit{food sources}, it is time to make these interact since currently nothing is happening and agents just wander around aimlessly. To make things more interesting we will  implement a working \textit{Gatherers} simulation. 

In the Gatherers-simulation agents will move around freely in a world that is rich in food. Every time an agents encounters some food, it will pick it up and carry it with him until it comes across another food source. When it does that, it will drop the first food source next to the second and move on. Eventually, an agent will gather all food and put it all together in one big pile. 

Naturally, it can take a while before an agent has done this, especially if it walks around randomly like our agents. A group of agents will be able to achieve this task faster if they work together, which is why you created 10 of them.
