Our environment is now totally empty. To resolve this we will add a simple floor.

\instruct{In the SimulationController, add the following code in the \textit{\_\_init\_\_} function\footnote{Make sure that you place it after the call to the parent constructor.}:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]

# Create a floor for the world
self.floor = breve.Floor()
self.floor.setTextureImage(None)
            
\end{lstlisting}

These two lines add a new floor object (which has a ground plane around $Y=0$). We set the texture to None to prevent the use of the (ugly) default texture.

To improve the visual aspects of the simulation we enable lighting and shadows. This should only be used for demonstration purposes as it makes the simulation run slower.

\instruct{Add the following snippet after the code for the floor:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# Set display settings
self.enableLighting()
self.enableShadows()
self.moveLight(breve.vector(80,100,0))
self.enableReflections()
self.enableSmoothDrawing()
\end{lstlisting}
